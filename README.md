# tindog-web-site

This little project was one of the first proposed on the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">course that I'm taking in the journey to become a FullStack Web Developer</a>.
The idea of doing this one was to practice the knowledge on basic frontent (HTML and CSS with Bootstrap).

I would like to thanks <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/">Doc Angela Yu</a> for this marvelous course.
