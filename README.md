# tindog-web-site

This little project was one of the first proposed on the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">course that I'm taking in the journey to become a FullStack Web Developer</a>.
The idea of doing this one was to practice the knowledge on basic Frontend (HTML and CSS with Bootstrap).

I would like to thanks @angelabauer for the marvelous course.
